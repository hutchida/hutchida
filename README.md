## Ello, ello

My name is Daniel Hutchings and I'm a front-end web developer for AKQA Berlin, primarily working with React and Next JS to build enterprise websites for global brands. Before joining the agency world I worked a lot with Python helping companies automate various processes. Here you will find some example repos that I've built in the past and am currently working on. My components library is a ongoing work-in-progress, a place to experiment and try out new packages and techniques, then import them in to websites. I'm currently pimping up my personal website and portfolio in my spare time. Please note, many commits I make are to private repos and won't be reflected in the history shown here. Feel free to reach out to me for anything...
