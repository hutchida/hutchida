## Daniel Hutchings | Frontend Developer

I'm a front-end web developer for the digital agency AKQA in Berlin, primarily working with React and Next JS to build enterprise websites for global brands. Before joining the agency world I worked a lot with Python helping companies automate processes. Here you will find some example repos that I've built in the past and am currently working on. My components library is a work-in-progress, a place to experiment and try out new packages and techniques. I'm currently pimping up my personal website and portfolio in my spare time. Feel free to reach out to me...
